        <h1>Idukki Dam</h1>
            <p>This is the world's second and Asia's first arch dam, constructed across the Kuravan and Kurathi hills. 550 ft. high and 650 ft. wide, the dam lies close to the Cheruthoni barrage. To its west is the Kulamavu Dam. Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary is located closeby. It is constructed and owned by the Kerala State Electricity Board. It supports a 780 MW hydroelectric power station in Moolamattom, which started generating power on 4 October 1975. The dam type is a concrete, double curvature parabolic, thin arc dam.
                Due to heavy rainfall in Kerala during 2018 monsoons, few gates of the Idukki Dam had been opened to release the water pressure on the reservoir.

        <h1>HillView Park</h1>
            <p>Hill View Park, A Worthy Place Located Nearby Idukki Dam. These days both Idukki and Cheruthoni Dam will not be always kept opened for the visitors coming from nearby area and other parts of the country. People would get the opportunity of walking along the dam top only on the festival and vacation times. At that time dam officials working there will charge Rs. 10/- per head to enter into the Dams.
                Many people who came here in unseason became frustrated as they would not be allowed to enter into the Dam. Here is the good news for those who missed the chance of enjoy seeing those giant dams. If you are not allowed to see the dams, you can just go to enjoy the nearby park called 'Hill View Park'.
                The park is situated at about 1.5 Km from the Idukki town and at about 350 ft above the dam water level.
